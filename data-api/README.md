# Data API module

The data API goal is to provide a simple API to allow users to retrieve sensors data.

## How to run it

Run the Maven command `mvn jetty:run` to start the data API server.

*NB: Before doing so, do not forget to run `mvn install` into the parent root folder to install the middleware.*
