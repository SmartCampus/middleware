# Data Processor module

The data processor goal is to provide a scalable processing module that processes sensors data from the message queue and stores them into the database.

## How to run it

Run the Maven command `mvn exec:java` to start a data processor instance.

*NB: Before doing so, do not forget to run `mvn install` into the parent root folder to install the middleware.*
